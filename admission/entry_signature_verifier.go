DESCRIPTION:

	Entry-signature verification at the operator's trust boundary.
	Thin wrapper around the SDK's signatures.VerifyEntry primitive
	with operator-side error mapping.

	The SDK owns the cryptographic gate logic (muEnableEntrySignatureVerify,
	muEnablePubKeyOnCurve, muEnableSignatureLength); the operator's
	job is to invoke the primitive on every inbound entry, resolve
	the signer DID to a public key via the configured DIDResolver,
	and map any failure to ErrSignatureInvalid for HTTP 401 dispatch.

KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:

  - DIDResolver is an interface, not a concrete type. Phase 4 wires
    a real did.VerifierRegistry; tests wire stubs. The Phase 2 trust
    model (nil resolver = wire-format integrity only) is preserved
    via the explicit nil check — the operator can run without DID
    resolution during the v0.3.0-tessera → v7.75 cutover.
  - Error mapping is the only operator-side logic. The SDK's
    signatures.VerifyEntry already enforces the cryptographic
    invariants (length, on-curve, ecdsa.Verify) gated by the
    mutation-audit constants; this file does not duplicate any of
    those checks.
  - Canonical hash comes from envelope.EntryIdentity, the SDK's
    single Tessera-aligned entry-hash primitive. Computing the hash
    inside this function (rather than accepting it as a parameter)
    keeps the verifier API impossible to misuse with a hash that
    doesn't match the entry's canonical bytes.

KEY DEPENDENCIES:

  - github.com/clearcompass-ai/ortholog-sdk/core/envelope: Entry,
    EntryIdentity.
  - github.com/clearcompass-ai/ortholog-sdk/crypto/signatures:
    VerifyEntry primitive (gated by SDK mutation switches).

// and will be tightened in a later commit once the DID resolver is
