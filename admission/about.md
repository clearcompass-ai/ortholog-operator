# admission

The operator's admission package houses the trust-boundary enforcement
stages that fire on every inbound entry before it reaches Tessera or
Postgres. Each file in this package is one stage; each stage is
fail-closed and returns a sentinel error the API layer maps to a
specific HTTP status.

## Pipeline ordering (Wave 1 plan v3 §3 Decision 1)

1. Deserialize (lives in `core/envelope`, not here)
2. **NFC check** — `nfc_check.go` (this package)
3. **Signature verify** — `entry_signature_verifier.go` (this package)
4. Schema dispatch (Wave 1 C2 — `api/submission.go` calls into `schema/`)
5. Witness quorum verify (Wave 1 S1 — `bls_quorum_verifier.go`, future)
6. Index population (Wave 1 C3-C4 — `store/`)
7. Tessera enqueue (existing `tessera/` adapter)

## Domain-agnostic boundary

The admission package never inspects `DomainPayload` for semantic
interpretation. It validates protocol-level invariants only —
structural envelope correctness, NFC discipline on identifiers,
signature cryptographic validity, witness quorum on embedded
checkpoints. Anything domain-specific (delegation depth, sealing-
order activation delay, court hierarchy) belongs to domain networks,
not here.

## No normalization, only assertion

The NFC check rejects non-NFC input rather than normalizing it. The
SDK's caller-normalizes contract (Decision 52) places normalization
at the caller boundary; downstream consumers compute SplitIDs against
the NFC-normalized DIDs the caller supplied. If the operator silently
normalized on ingress, the canonical hash the caller signed and the
bytes the operator stored would diverge — a soundness break dressed
up as a usability feature.
